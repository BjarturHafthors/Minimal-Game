The controls for the game are simple - W/S to go forward/backwards. A/D to turn the ship. Space to shoot. That's it!

The spaceship and orb assets for the game were gotten from opengameart.org for free. The background was made by myself, and the Logo was made by a friend.

The game has some depth and visually changes as players survive for longer, as well as the enemies getting a little better as the player advances.

The executable file is within the Build folder.
